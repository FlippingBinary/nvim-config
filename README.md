# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

This configuration is based on the starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

I was using LunarVim, but got tired of how brittle it was so I switched to LazyVim.
LazyVim is a plugin that brings a lot of useful defaults to make NeoVim an IDE quickly and easily.

My development centers around Rust, SvelteKit, and Typescript at the moment, so the configuration includes plugins for those languages.

This configuration is limited to Linux for now, but I may use it on Windows and make adjustments as needed.
